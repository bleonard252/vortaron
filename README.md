# Vortaron
"Vortaron" is (accusative) Esperanto for "Dictionary." It's a simple app: choose your languages, put in your word, and press "Define."

The tricky part is knowing what to put in:
* English: use the "bare infinitive" (or imperative) for verbs (i.e. run, walk, play). Everything else is straightforward.
* Esperanto: use the infinitive for verbs and the nominative for nouns and verbs.
* Latin: use the 1st person present active indicative (1st principal part, i.e. amo, venio).

Currently missing features:
* English support as a word language.
* Latin support as a word language.
* Esperanto support as an app language.
* IPA for pronunciation.
* Links in some places, maybe.
* Word use examples, as shown below a definition on Wiktionary.
* Principal parts, reformed. Maybe some other stuff like grammatical gender.

Intentionally missing:
* Other forms of words, and conjugations.

These features may be missing so that the app is eligible for use in classes (they define words, but don't give you the answers).
