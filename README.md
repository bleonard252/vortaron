# Vortaron
"Vortaron" is (accusative) Esperanto for "Dictionary." It's a simple app: choose your languages, put in your word, and press "Define."

The tricky part is knowing what to put in:
* English: use the "bare infinitive" (or imperative) for verbs (i.e. run, walk, play). Everything else is straightforward.
* Esperanto: use the infinitive for verbs and the nominative for nouns and verbs.
* Latin: use the 1st person present active indicative (1st principal part, i.e. amo, venio).

> Note: "Word language" indicates that you can look up a word from the language (i.e. a Latin word). "App language" indicates that you can get the definitions back in a given language, as well as change the language the app uses for sorting, styling, and labeling (i.e. part of speech headers and the Define button). "Complete support" indicates that both can be used and all features are supported for that language.
